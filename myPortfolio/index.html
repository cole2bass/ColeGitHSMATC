                I first became interested in computer programming in junior high school while making simple programs
                using formulas and functions in Microsoft Excel.  That interest led me to take a Java Programming class
                in high school where I made several projects and games.

            <p class="paragraph">
                After spending 2 years at Mountainland Applied
                Technology College (MATC) studying Information Technology certifications, I decided to attend Western
                Governors University (WGU) where I completed a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology in December
                2015.

            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">

                At those schools, I earned multiple industry certifications including: Cisco CCENT and CCNA; CompTia
                A+, Network+, Security+, Project+, and Linux+; CIW JavaScript Specialist, Database Design Specialist, Web
                Design Specialist, and Web Foundation Specialist; as well as Microsoft MTA certifications in Windows
                Server Administration, Security Fundamentals, Windows Operating System Fundamentals, Networking
                Fundamentals, Software Development Fundamentals, and Database Fundamentals.

            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">

                While studying at WGU, I
                worked full time for 22 months at LDS tech as a Quality Assurance Engineer running automated tests as
                part of one of their software development groups.  I am currently studying software development at MATC
                and hope to eventually start a career as a computer programmer.
